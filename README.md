# S&P Index Fund Predictor #

This project uses historical S&P 500 data to build a machine learning model that predicts whether the stock market will go up or down the next day. The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier and evaluates the precision of its predictions.

# Technologies Used #

Python: Primary programming language.

yfinance: Library for downloading historical stock market data.

pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

scikit-learn: Machine learning model training and evaluation.

matplotlib: Data visualization.

# Usage

**Download and Preprocess Data:**

The script downloads historical S&P 500 data using yfinance and saves it to a CSV file.

It preprocesses the data by adding features like "Tomorrow" and "Target".

**Train the Model:**

The data is split into training and test sets.

A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training data.

**Evaluate the Model:**

The model's precision is evaluated on the test set.

Results are visualized using matplotlib.

**Run the Code:**

Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.
